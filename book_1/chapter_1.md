# Chapter One
## THE BOY WHO WASN'T UNLIVED

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, liked flexing that they very basic, thank u. Tbh they were the last people you'd think would be sus, because they were all fax no printer.

Mr. Dursley was adulting at a firm called Grunnings, which made drills.

He was a dummy thiccc (w/ three Cs) man with hardly any neck, although he had an absolute unit of a mustache. Mrs. Dursley was a total Karen with zero chill and had hella neck, which came in very useful when she was stalking her neighbours and not minding her own.

The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley who they thought was the main character. The Dursleys were mostly thriving, but they also had lowkey tea which didn't pass the vibe check and their greatest fear was to get called out and cancelled. They were girlbossing too close to the sun and didn't think their clout could bounce back if their fam the Potters were revealed. Milf Lily Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sis, but Mrs. D had gone ghost; in fact, Mrs. D pretended she didnt have a sister, because Lil and her deadbeat hubby were straight up cringe. If the neighbors ever caught sight of the Potters, it'd be a big yikes. The Dursleys knew the Potters had a tiny boi, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the in-laws away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a gross being like that.

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray (fight me) Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley spilled the tea as she was tryna put a screaming Dudley into his heckin high chair.

None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.

At half past eight, chunky Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's driveway.

It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar--a cat reading a map. For a sec, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he'd seen--then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive--no, _looking_ at the sign; cats couldn't read maps _or_ signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his thinking-organ. As he drove toward the town he had no thoughts, head empty, except for some drills he had to sell. _Let's get this bread_, he thought.
